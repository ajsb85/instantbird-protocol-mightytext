We are different from apps like Google Voice.  Google Voice requires the user to set up a different number or to port their number to Google Voice.  With MightyText, you can keep using your same phone number, as usual for texting. However, you can use Google Voice in parallel for texting SMS, with no problem. Google Voice does not use your carrier phone number typically.

Coming Soon: integration (backup SMS and MMS) with Google Drive (Gdrive). If you'd like to see integration with Google Drive, Dropbox, Google Voice, or Google Docs, please contact us: http://help.mightytext.net

NOTE: We use the same push technology that is found in chrome to phone and chrome to mobile.  If you experience problems when sending message to the phone, please test on chrome to phone and chrome to mobile.
